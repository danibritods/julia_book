# [Introduction to the Julia Language](https://github.com/dbs-97/julia_book/blob/master/DBS-Julia.pdf)
### PT-BR ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·
I'm written this book for my Programming Languages Paradigms class. 
It is a short introduction to the Julia Language with its history, characteristics, basic sintax, examples, tools and references. 
I've choosen Julia for its unique multiple dispatch feature, and its use in data science, my area of interest.
